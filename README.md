### ⚠️ PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT ⚠️


# DE10-Lite FPGA Emulator

## 
This project aims to simulate VHDL circuits on an Intel DE10-Lite FPGA board emulator.


## Main goals
[ ] Integrate the visual interface with the C++/VPI code (using CMake)

## Future goals
[ ] Generic FPGA board project instead of aiming only DE10-Lite

[ ] Customizable board interface

[ ] USBPort integration (to enable e.g communication between Java/Kotlin modules with the emulator)
